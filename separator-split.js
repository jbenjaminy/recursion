/* Exercise 5: Split a string based upon a separator (similar to String.prototype.split). 

The split() method splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings.
Syntax
Edit

str.split([separator[, limit]])

Parameters

separator:
    Optional. Specifies the character(s) to use for separating the string. The separator is treated as a string or a regular expression. If separator is omitted, the array returned contains one element consisting of the entire string. If separator is an empty string, str is converted to an array of characters.
limit:

    Optional. Integer specifying a limit on the number of splits to be found. The split() method still splits on every match of separator, until the number of split items match the limit or the string falls short of separator.

Return value:

An array of strings split at each point where the separator occurs in the given string.
